# Python has a print function
print("I'm Python. Nice to meet you!") # => I'm Python. Nice to meet you!

# By default the print function also prints out a newline at the end.
# Use the optional argument end to change the end string.
print("Hello, World", end="!") # => Hello, World!

# Simple way to get input data from console
input_string_var = input("Enter some data: ") # Returns the data as a string

# There are no declarations, only assignments.
# Convertion in naming variables is snake_case style
some_var = 5
some_var # => 5

# Accessing a previosly unassigned variable is an exception.
# See Control Flow to learn more about exception handling.
#some_unknown_var # Raises a NameError

# if can be used as an expression
# Equivalent of C's '?:' ternary operator
"yay!" if 0 > 1 else "nay!" # => "nay!"

# Lists store sequences
li = []
# You cam start with a prefield list
other_li = [4, 5, 6]

# Add stuff to the end of a list with append
li.apppend(1)  # li is now [1]
li.apppend(2)  # li is now [1, 2]
li.apppend(4)  # li is now [1, 2, 4]
li.apppend(3)  # li is now [1, 2, 4, 3]
# Remove from the end with pop
li.pop()
# Let's put it back
li.append(3) # li is now [1, 2, 4] again

# Access a list like you would any array
li[0]  # => 1
# Look at the last element
li[-1] # => 3

# Looking out of bounds is an IndexError
li[4] # Raises an IndexError

# You can look at ranges with slice syntax.
# The start index is included, the end index is not
# (It,s a closed/open range for you mathy types.)
li[1:3]    # Return list from index 1 to 3 => [2, 4]
li[2:]     # Return list satrting from index 2 => [4, 3]
li[:3]     # Return list from beginning until index 3 => [1, 2, 4]
li[::2]    # Return list selecting elements with a strp size of 2 => [1, 4]
# Use any combination of these to make advanced slices
# li[start:end:step]

# Make a one layer deep copy using slices
li2 = li[:] # => li2 = [1, 2, 3, 4] but (li2 is li) will result in false.

# Remove arbitrary elements from a list with "del"
del li[2] # li is now [1, 2, 3]

# Remove first occurance of a value
li.remove(2) # li is now [1, 3]
li.remove(2) # Raises a ValueError as 2 is not in the list

# Insert an element at a specific index
li.insert(1, 2) # => li is now [1, 2, 3] again

# Get the index of the first item found matching the argument
li.index(2) # => 1
li.index(4) # => Raises a ValueError as 4 is not in the list

# You can add lists
# Note: values for li and for other_li are not modified.
li + other_li # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Concatenate lists with "extend()"
li.extend(other_li) # => Now li is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Check fr existence in a list with "in"
1 in li # => True

# Examine the length with "len()"
len(li) # => 6

# Tuples are like lists but are immutable.
tup = (1, 2, 3)
tup[0]     # => 1
tup[0] = 3 # Raises a TypeError 

# Note that a tuple of length one has to have coma after the last element but
# tuples of other lengths, even zero, do not.
type((1))  # => <class 'int'>
type((1,)) # => <class 'tuple'>
type(())   # => <class 'tuple'>

# You can do most of the list operations on tuples too
len(tup)        # => 3
tup + (4, 5, 6) # => (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
tup[:2]         # => (1, 2)
2 in tup        # => True

# You can unpack tuples (or lists) into variables
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3) # a is now 1, b is now 2, c is now 3
# You can also do extended unpacking
a, *b, c = (1, 2, 3, 4) # a is now 1, b is now [2, 3], and c is now 4
# Tuples are created by default if you leave out the parenteses
d, e, f = 4, 5, 6 # tuple 4, 5, 6 is unpacked into variables d, e, and f
# respectively such that d = 4, e = 5, f = 6
# Now look how easy it is to swap two values
e, d = d, e # d is now 5, and e is now 4

# Dictionaries store mappings from keys to values
empty_dict = {}
# Here is a prefilled dictionary
filled_dict = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

# Note keys for dictionaries have to be imutable types. This is to ensure that
# the key can be converted to a constant hash value for quick looks-up.
# Immutable types include ints, floats, strings, tuples.
invalid_dict = {[1,2,3]: "123"} # => Yield a TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
valid_dict = {(1,2,3):[1,2,3]}  # Values can be of any type, however.

# Look up values with []
filled_dict["one"] # => 1

# Get all values as an iterable with "values()". Once again we need to wrap it
# in list() to get it out of the iterable. Note - Same as above regarding key
# ordering.
list(filled_dict.values()) # => [3, 2, 1] in Python <3.7
list(filled_dict.values()) # => [1, 2, 3] in Python 3.7+

# Check for existance of keys in a dictionary with "in"
"one" in filled_dict # => True
1 in filled_dict     # => False

# Looking up a non-existing key is a KeyError
filled_dict["four"] # KeyError

# Use "get()" method to avoid the KeyError
filled_dict.get("one")     # => 1
filled_dict.get("four")    # => None
# The get method supports a default a dictionary only if the given key isn't present
filled_dict.get("one", 4)  # => 1
filled_dict.get("four", 4) # => 4

# "setdefault()" inserts into a dictionary only if the given key isn't present
filled_dict.setdefault({"five", 5}) # filled_dict["five"] is set to 5
filled_dict.setdefault({"five", 6}) # filled_dict["five"] is still 5

# Adding to a dictionary
filled_dict.update({"four": 4}) # => {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
filled_dict["four"] = 4         # another way to add to dict

# Remove keys from a dictionary with del
del filled_dict["one"] # Removes the key "one" from filled dict

# From Python 3.5 you can also use the additional unpacking options
{"a": 1, **{"b": 2}} # => {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
{"a": 1, **{"a": 2}} # => {'a': 2}

# Sets store ... well sets
empty_set = set()
# Initialize a set with a bunch of values.
some_set = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4} # some_set is now {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Similiar to keys of a dictionary, elements of a set have to be immutable.
invalid_set = {[1], 1} # => Raises a TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
valid_set = {(1,), 1}

# Add one more item to the set
filled_set = some_set
filled_set.add(5) # filled_set is now {1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5}
# Sets do not have duplicate elements
filled_set.add(5) # it remains as before {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Do set intersection with $
other_set = {3, 4, 5, 6}
filled_set & other_set # => {3, 4, 5}

# Do set union with |
filled_set | other_set # => {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Do set difference with -
{1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 5} # => {1, 4}

# Do set symmetric difference with ^
{1, 2, 3, 4} ^ {2, 3, 5} # => {1, 4, 5}

# Check if set on the left is superset of set on the right
{1, 2} >= {1, 2, 3} # False

# Check if set on the left is a subset of set the right
{1, 2} <= {1, 2, 3} # True

# Check for existence in a set with in
2 in filled_set  # True
10 in filled_set # False

# Make a one layer deep copy
filled_set = some_set.copy() # filled_set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
filled_set is some_set       # => False
