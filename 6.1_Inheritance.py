## 6.1 Inheritance
##################################################

# Inheritance allows new child classes to be defined that inherit methods and
# variables from their parent class.

# Using the Human class defined above as the base or parent class, we can
# define a child class, Superhero, which inherits variables like "species",
# "name", and "age", as well as methods, like "sing" and "grunt"
# from the Human class, but can also have its own unique properties.

# To take advantage of modularization by file you could place the classes above
# in their own files, say, human.py

# To import functions from other files use the following format
# from "filename-without-extension" import "function-or-class"

from human import Human

# Specify the parent class(es) as parameters to the class definition
class Superhero(Human):

    # If the child class should inherit all of the parent's definitions without
    # any modifications, you can just use the "pass" keyword (and nothing else)
    # but in this case it is commented out allow for a unique child class:
    # pass

    # Child classes can override their parents' attributes
    species = "Superhuman"

    # Children automatically inherit their parent class's constructor including
    # its arguments, but can also define additional arguments or definitions
    # and override its methods such as the class constructor.
    # adds the "superpower" and "movie" arguments:
    def __init__(self, name, movie=False,
                 superpowers=["super strength", "bulletproofing"]):
        
        # add additional class attributes:
        self.fictional = True
        self.movie = movie
        # be aware of mutable default values, sice defaults are shared
        self.superpowers = superpowers

        #The "super" function lets you access the parent class's methods
        # that are overidden by the child, in this case, the __init__ method.
        # This calls the parent class constructor
        super().__init__(name)

    # override the sing method
    def sing(self):
        return "Dun, dun, DUN!"
    
    # add an additional instance method
    def boast(self):
        for power in self.superpowers:
            print("I wield the power of {pow}!".format(pow=power))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sup = Superhero(name="Tick")

    # Instance type checks
    if isinstance(sup, Human):
        print("I am human")
    if type(sup) is Superhero:
        print("I am a superhero")

    # Get the "Method Resolution Order" used by both getattr() and super()
    # (the order in which classes are searched for an attribute or method)
    print(Superhero.__mro__)    # => (<class '__main__.Superhero>,
                                # => <class 'human.Human'>, <class 'object'>)

    # Calls parent method but uses its own class attribute
    print(sup.get_species())    # => SuperHuman

    # Calls overridden method
    print(sup.sing())           # => Dun, dun, DUN!

    # Calls method from Human
    sup.say("Spoon")            # => Tick: Spoon

    # Calls method taht exists only in Superhero
    sup.boast()                 # => I wield the power of super strength!
                                # => I wield the power of bulletproofing!

    # Inherited class attribute
    sup.age = 31
    print(sup.age)              # => 31

    # Attribute that only exists within Superhero
    print("Am I Oscar eligible" + str(sup.movie))
